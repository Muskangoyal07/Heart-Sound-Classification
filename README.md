# Heart-Sound-Classification
# Project Description
Heart Sound Classification is a deep learning project aimed at classifying heart sounds to aid in the diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions. This project employs transfer learning using the AlexNet architecture and various signal processing techniques to classify heart sounds as normal or abnormal. It leverages MATLAB for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

# Features
Heart Sound Data Processing: Reads and processes heart sound recordings from multiple datasets.

Signal Filtering: Applies bandpass filtering to heart sound signals.

Feature Extraction: Uses Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features extracted from spectrograms of heart sound signals.

Deep Learning Model: Implements transfer learning with AlexNet to classify heart sounds.

Performance Evaluation: Calculates and displays performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score.
# Technologies Used
Programming Languages: MATLAB

Libraries and Toolboxes: Signal Processing Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox

Deep Learning Framework: AlexNet for transfer learning
